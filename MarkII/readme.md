# USB C Daughter/Breakout board for Norbaforce 

For the Norbaforce (MKii/iii). Features USB-C port, ESD protection, over voltage protection, CC1 & CC2 resistors to work with USB-C to C cables.  

_(2 daughterboards in this design, RF1 & RF2, to save money manufacturing)_

[TODO: Once samples arrive include photo with riser)

## Production
* Production files are set up for JLCPCB.  
* "Remove Order Number" option choose "Specify Location" (uses "JLCJLC" on silkscreen for order # position)
* _Note only Gerber file is included so part files would need to be generated from KiCad.  In addition these would need to be manually soldered for the USB riser with pin headers_

| Part              | Adjustment   |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| USB-C Connector   | Down 5.06mm   |
| JST EH Connector  | Up 3.75mm   |
| JST PH  Connector | Rotate 90Â°, Right ~0.3mm |

## BOM

| LCSC part # | Description   | Value | Package  | Amount |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------:|
| C261942     | Fuse          |       | 0805     | 2      |
| C7519       | ESD           |       | SOT23-6  | 2      |
| C212411     | Resistor      | 5.1K  | 0805     | 4      |
| C21217      | Capacitor     | 4.7nF | 0805     | 2      |
| C165948     | Connector     |       | TH       | 2      |
| C265068     | Connector (EH)| 4 pin | TH       | 2      |
| C265104     | Connector (PH)| 5 pin | SMT      | 2      |
(Pin headers 2.54mm pitch)

_Note if the capacitor or resistors are out of stock they can be replaced with 0805 sized component with similar specs._

## Revisions
1.0
* Initial prototype

1.1
* Added usb riser section to better fit Norbaforce
* Updated Design so that both RF1 & RF2 models can be printed in one file (saves money when manufacturing)
* Flipped silkscreen orientation for those with a clear case.  
* Updated JST PH connector to surface mount instead of through hole.
