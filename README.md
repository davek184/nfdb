# Manufacturing
* Manufacturing files are set up for JLCPCB. 
* Thickness does not matter suggest standard 1.6mm 
* "Remove Order Number" option choose "Specify Location" (uses "JLCJLC" on silkscreen for order # position)
* Assemble top side
* Choose assembly file version (No connector: need to solder then yourself, RF1 or RF2 as indicated above in renders)
* Manual part adjustments from KiCad Outputs (already handled in manufacturing files)
| Part              | Adjustment   |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| USB-C Connector   | Down 5.06mm   |
| JST EH Connector  | Up 3.75mm   |
| JST PH  Connector | Rotate 90Â°, Down 4mm |
